 abstract = {In vivo--labeled MSCs demonstrated significantly higher
ferumoxytol uptake compared with ex vivo--labeled cells.
With electron microscopy, iron oxide nanoparticles were
localized in secondary lysosomes. In vivo--labeled cells
demonstrated significant T2 shortening effects in vitro
and in vivo when they were compared with unlabeled control cells (T2 in vivo, 15.4 vs 24.4 msec; P < .05) and could be tracked in osteochondral defects for 4 weeks.
Histologic examination confirmed the presence of iron in
labeled transplants and defect remodeling.

Conclusion: Intravenous ferumoxytol can be used to effectively label
MSCs in vivo and can be used for tracking of stem cell
transplants with MR imaging. This method eliminates
risks of contamination and biologic alteration of MSCs
associated with ex vivo--labeling procedures.},
