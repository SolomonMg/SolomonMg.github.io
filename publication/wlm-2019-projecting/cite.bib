 abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic change in horserace coverage of elections in the
U.S.---shifting focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic
forecasts that emphasize candidates' chance of victory. Could this shift in the political information environment affect election outcomes? We use experiments to show
that forecasting increases certainty about an election's outcome, confuses many, and
decreases turnout. Furthermore, we show that election forecasting has become prominent in the media, particularly in outlets with liberal audiences, and show that such
coverage tends to more strongly affect the candidate who is ahead---raising questions
about whether they contributed to Trump's victory over Clinton in 2016. We bring
empirical evidence to this question, using ANES data to show that Democrats and
Independents expressed unusual confidence in a decisive 2016 election outcome---and
that the same measure of confidence is associated with lower reported turnout.},
