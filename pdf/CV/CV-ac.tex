%\resheading{Projects \& Working Papers}
%\begin{description}
%
%\item[News, political knowledge, and cross-cutting exposure in Social Media] Develops political media ideal point estimate (with Will Fithian) that leverages users' news sharing behavior to generate ideological score for users and content.  Combines this data with self-reported political affiliation to investigate the question of the extent to which users maintain relationships and engage with other partisans (homophily) versus maintaining friendships that cut across ideological boundaries.  Examines inter-religious, inter-gender, and inter-racial ties and interaction for comparison.  Analyzes a massive quasi-experiment designed to estimate effect of exposure to news in social media on political knowledge and participation.

%\item[Cross-cutting exposure to News in Social Media] Develops political media ideal point estimate (with Will Fithian) that leverages users' news sharing behavior to generate ideological score for users and content in various social media platforms.  Investigates the question of the extent to which users maintain relationships and engage with other partisans (homophily) versus maintaining friendships that cut across ideological boundaries.  
%
%
%\item[Representation \& constituent communication in social media] with Justin Grimmer.  Examines representative-constituent communication that takes place in social media: position-taking, credit-claiming, negative portrayals of the opposing party.  Also examines how the media shape these issues.  
%
%\item[Bias in the flesh: Skin complexion, attack ads, and minority elections]  Presents a method to analyze skin complexion in political advertisements by utilizing hue, saturation, and value (HSV) data encoded in digital images; documents correlations between negative advertisements and irregular skin complexion in presidential campaign advertisements; examines affective responses to such photographic alterations in a national sample of U.S. citizens.  Shows that the measure is strongly correlated with electoral victory among 2010 minority candidates for national and state-level offices; that presenting participants with darker images of a minority candidate decreases feelings of warmth and the probability of voting for the candidate in online experiments (with Shanto Iyengar).
%
%\item[``Social network analysis labs in R''] with Sean Westwood, Mike Nowak \& Dan McFarland. Provides a complete
%introduction to social network analysis using the R statistical programming language, along with demonstration data.
